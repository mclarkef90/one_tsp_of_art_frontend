One Teaspoon of Art

One Teaspoon of Art is a site meant to teach users about at least one work of art per visit. Its database holds information about artists and artworks they created.

Upon visiting the site, one work will be randomly selected and presented to the viewer. They can review this information and "like it" or they can search the database to see other artists and artworks.

Users may contribute to the database by creating, updating, and deleting artist and artwork entries.
